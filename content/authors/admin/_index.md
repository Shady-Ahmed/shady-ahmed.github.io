    summary: |
      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

I am a distinguished postrdoctoral fellow in scientific computing at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. I am affilated to the scientific machine learning and uncertainty quantification team within the advanced computing, mathematics and data division. I like to develop new algorithms that advance numerical weather and climate predictions using multifidelity learning, reduced order modeling, reinforcement learning, and causal discovery.
